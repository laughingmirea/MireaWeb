The University was established at the time when the country and the Russian people were healing the wounds inflicted by the Second World War. On May 28, 1947, V.M. Molotov, Deputy Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers, signed the Decree of the Council of Ministers that provided for the transformation of the Correspondence Institute for Advanced Studies of Engineering and Technical Workers of the Ministry of Power Plants into the All-Union Correspondence Power Engineering Institute for training and advanced studies of engineers, which was followed by the transfer thereof to the Ministry of Higher Education of the USSR. For thousands and thousands of ex-soldiers who were back from the front and those who were heroically working in the rear, education by correspondence was at that time the only possible way to acquire a new specialty or improve their qualifications. The Government was also interested in the development of education by correspondence, since millions of people of the working-age perished during the Great Patriotic War and every pair of hands and &quot;bright&quot; minds engaged in the revival of the country&rsquo;s economy and directly in industrial production were highly valued.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe newly established Institute was meant to become a leading university in the system of correspondence education in energy and radio engineering specialties. Moreover, from the very beginning it was believed that the Institute would become the largest among the correspondence educational institutions of the country, which would be enhanced by the presence of its branches in six regions of the USSR. Specialists in power engineering who would be working in the North-Western regions of the RSFSR and the Baltic republics were trained by the Leningrad branch, those to be working in Ukraine and Moldova received their training in the Kiev branch, the Transcaucasian republics specialists studied in Baku, the Central Asian republics trained specialists in the Tashkent branch, the Urals region trained their students in Sverdlovsk, Siberia, and the Far East &ndash; in Novosibirsk.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThree rooms (with a total area of just 67 sq. m.) on the premises of the Moscow Power Engineering College at Kropotkinskaya (now Prechistenskaya) Embankment, 11 became actually the birth-place of the new University. For several months it housed the entire educational resources and facilities of the newly created Institute, and later, when the Institute finally settled in one of the buildings of the Moscow Power Engineering Institute named after V.M. Molotov (late 1949), the technical college housed an educational and consulting center, a Marxism-Leninism studies classroom, the central library and a reading room. The work of the branches was organized on the rented premises.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the first post-war years, with the difficulties inevitable at the time, the formation and the development of the new educational institution, was carried out by the Institute teaching staff and the employees under the guidance of V.K. Ganin, the first Rector of the Institute. They did everything possible to bring the Institute up to the standards set by the Government Decree and other regulations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVasily Kondratyevich Ganin, worked as Rector of the Institute from July 1947 to April 1948.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVasily Kondratyevich Ganin was born on March 3, 1903. He graduated from the Communist University of Siberia (1925), later - from the Moscow Power Engineering Institute (1932), and completed two courses of the Economic Institute of Red Professors (1937). Candidate of Technical Sciences, Associate Professor at the Department of General and Theoretical Heat Engineering.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the beginning of December, the Institute already had over 1100 students studying at six departments (with 11 specialties), and more than 3600 students of the only Department of Advanced Engineering for graduate engineers in the country&#39;s technical universities. Students below the age of 20 accounted for only 9 percent of the total number, while the largest share (66 percent) were young people in their mid-20-s and early 30-s.<br />\r\nIt is worth mentioning that by the end of the first academic year, about 40 percent of the students (425 people) had become members of the radio engineering department, and subsequently the popularity of the radio engineering specialty among the applicants was constantly growing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmong the teaching staff of the Institute there were 19 doctors of sciences and professors, 30 candidates of sciences and associate professors. At the time of its formation, there were already up to 10 laureates of the Stalin Prize, the highest award in the field of science and technology; they worked at different departments of the new Institute. Since December 1947, the Department of Electrical Physics was headed by N.N. Andreev, an outstanding scientist, founder of the national school of physical and theoretical acoustics, Corresponding Member (later - Full Member) of the USSR Academy of Sciences (now the Acoustic Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences is bearing his name).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn September 1, 1947, admission to postgraduate studies was announced in all specialties and departments of the Institute. Just a year later, 34 people began their academic work, and already in 1950, there was the first defense of the dissertation by B.N. Tardov, postgraduate student, who later became a major specialist in the field of electrical materials science.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn November 25, 1947, the first meeting of the Board of the All-Union Correspondence Power Engineering Institute was held, in January of the following year, the Institute&#39;s Charter was approved, its library funds formed, and a little later the editorial and publishing department was created. The editorial review board was approved under the guidance of its director, which made it possible to expand work on the preparation and distribution of educational and methodological literature to other universities of the energy profile.<br />\r\nIn October 1947, grassroots organizations were formed at the Institute - the trade union division (N.N. Kalitvyansky, the first chairman of the local committee, candidate of technical sciences, Associate Professor, head of the department of the theory of mechanisms, machines and machine parts) and the communist party organization (G.F. Fokin, secretary of the party bureau, senior lecturer of the Department of Descriptive Geometry and Graphics, participant in the Great Patriotic War was at the head of it).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn May 1948, A.L. Bankwitzer took over as the Institute director (May 1948 - November 1950)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBankwitzer Achilles Lvovich was born on 27 of March 1892. Graduated from the Kiev Commercial Institute (1916), took a postgraduate course at the Physical and Chemical Institute named after L.Ya. Karpov (1935). Participated in the Civil, Soviet-Finnish and the Great Patriotic Wars.<br />\r\nIn the years of his rectorship, the first specialists graduated from the Institute, among them were those who came to the Institute to take just the senior courses: in July 9, people received engineering degrees, four of which &ndash; cum laude.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn May of the same year, an organizational meeting of the Scientific and Technical Society was held, the temporarily N.N. Andreev became head of the organization. The Society became the initiator of the first scientific and technical conference at the Institute (June 1950). Presentations and reports were made not only by the Institute&rsquo;s lecturers and outside specialists, but also graduate students, and the students of the Institute. The involvement of the teaching staff (often of related departments) in solving specific problems of the national economy through the agreements on cooperation signed by the Institute with industrial enterprises and research institutes dates back to this time, and eventually reached a really wide scope.<br />\r\n(Gorky Automobile Plant, Research Institute of the Ministry of Aviation Industry, etc.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe time between 1940-s and 1950-s was marked by the beginning of serious structural transformations of the Correspondence Institute: in August 1949, one of the departments (the hydropower department) was closed down; in September 1950, the students and lecturers of the Baku (Caucasian) branch were transferred to the correspondence department of the Azerbaijan Industrial Institute. At the same time, the Institute started a network of educational and consulting points at the end of 1949, its Moscow Study Support Center began to function on the basis of the Moscow Power Engineering Institute (MPEI).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>History of the Moscow State University of Instrument Engineering and Computer Science.</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe University was established by the order of the People&#39;s Commissariat of Local Industry of the RSFSR, No. 1168, of September 16, 1936 as the Moscow Republican Correspondence Institute of the Metal-Working Industry, which by Decree No. 951 of the Council of the People&#39;s Commissars of the USSR, of August 29, 1938 and Order No. 783 of the People&#39;s Commissariat of Local Industry of the RSFSR of September 21, 1938, was declared the Moscow Correspondence Institute of the Metal Industry, an independent correspondence higher educational institution.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy Order No. 14083-r of the Council of Ministers of the USSR of September 4, 1950 and by Order No. 1705 of the Minister of Higher Education of the USSR of September 27, 1950, the Moscow Correspondence Institute of Metal Industry was reorganized into the All-Union Correspondence Machine-Building Institute, which, by Resolution No. 337 of the Council of Ministers of the USSR of March 14, 1988, and by order No. 230 of the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Specialized Education of the RSFSR, dated April 21, 1988, was transformed into the Moscow Institute of Instrumentation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy Order No. 647 of the State Committee of the Russian Federation for Higher Education, dated July 1, 1994, the Moscow Institute of Instrument Engineering was renamed into the Moscow State Academy of Instrument Engineering and Informatics and was reorganized by Order No. 1945, of the Ministry of General and Professional Education of the Russian Federation dated July 17, 1998. The Moscow Radio-mechanical Technical School was acceded to the Institute.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn August 17, 2004, the Moscow State Academy of Instrument Engineering and Informatics was included in the Unified State Register of Legal Entities as the State Educational Institution of Higher Professional Education - the Moscow State Academy of Instrument Engineering and Informatics, which was later renamed into Moscow State University of Instrument Engineering and Informatics, a State educational institution of higher professional education.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy order No. 1879 of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, dated May 27, 2011, the state educational institution of higher professional education Moscow State University of Instrument Engineering and Informatics was renamed into the Federal State Budgetary Educational Institution of Higher Professional Education - the Moscow State University of Instrument Engineering and Informatics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2014, it became part of the Moscow Technological University<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The History of Lomonosov Moscow State University of Fine Chemical Technology</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nLomonosov Moscow State University of Fine Chemical Technology is one of the oldest universities in Russia. The University&rsquo;s history goes back to the Moscow Higher Courses for Women.<br />\r\nThe courses were organized on July 1 (14th, new style) July 1900. Initially, the courses had two departments: of physics and mathematics and of history and philosophy. At the Department of Physics and Mathematics, two more departments were soon organized: mathematical and that of natural sciences; and a few years later still more departments were created &ndash; the medical and chemical and pharmaceutical departments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1918, the Women&rsquo;s Courses were transformed into the 2nd Moscow State University consisting of three departments &ndash; departments of history, medicine, and chemistry.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1930, the 2nd Moscow State University was divided into three independent universities; The Moscow Institute of Fine Chemical Technology became the successor to the Department of Chemistry.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor achievements in academic research and training of specialists, in 1940 the Institute was named after M.V. Lomonosov, and in 1971, it was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1992, the Institute received the status of an academy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2011, by the Order of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, the Institute of Fine Chemical Technology received the status of a university. In the same year, it was granted a perpetual license with the right to conduct educational activities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThus, the history of the Institute can be divided into a number of stages:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Women&rsquo;s Courses (1900 - 1918);</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>the 2nd Moscow State University (1918 - 1930);</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>the pre-war period of the Institute (1930 - 1941);</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>the Institute functioning during the Great Patriotic War (1941 - 1945) and the post-war period of the Institute (1945 - 1970);</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>the Institute during the period of the &quot;developed socialism&quot; and &quot;perestroika&quot; (1970 - 1992);</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>the academy period (1992 - 2011);</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>the University period - since 2011.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In different years, the most prominent scholars and professors worked at the Institute: academicians A.N. Nesmeyanov, S.S. Nametkin, I.N. Nazarov, Ya.K. Syrkin, V.M. Rodionov, G.G. Urazov, S.S. Medvedev, I.P. Alimarin, K.A. Andrianov, I.V. Tananaev, N.N. Nekrasov, I.L. Knunyats, N.P. Fedorenko, V.I. Gol&#39;dansky, Corresponding Members of the Academy of Sciences A.N. Bashkirov, V.V. Lebedinsky, B.A. Sakharov, K.A. Bolshakov, A.N. Righteous, R.P. Evstigneev, professor A.A. Eichenwald, V.T.

Netushil.<br />\r\nLomonosov Moscow State University of Fine Chemical Technology was established at the time of the Moscow Higher Courses for Women and the 2nd Moscow State University by such top notch scholars as N.E. Zhukovsky, S.A. Chaplygin, V.I. Vernadsky, N. D. Zelinsky.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The History of the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Technical Aesthetics (widely known as VNIITE)</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Technical Aesthetics was founded in 1962. The creation of such an institution served as an initial stage in the development of design activity in Russia. The main task of the Institute was to organize and develop design activity in the republics, regions and industries, to create foundations for professional activity. Since 1967, VNIITE has been conducting expert examination for awarding industrial goods the quality mark.<br />\r\nPrior to 1991, VNIITE was in charge of design bureaus at enterprises manufacturing consumer goods. VNIITE had 10 branches, the Institute guiding the activity of special design bureaus at enterprises, and the Center for Technical Aesthetics was also functioning at the time; it carried out work to promote and popularize design activity in the country and abroad. In 1992, the Institute was renamed into the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Technical Aesthetics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1968, VNIITE formed a system for training highly qualified research personnel in technical aesthetics. Currently, the Institute has a Board for awarding doctoral and candidate titles D217.003.01 approved by order No. 203-231 of the Federal Service for Supervision in Education and Science of 15.02.2008 in specialties 17.00.06 - Technical Aesthetics and Design (Art History) and 19.00.03 - Labor Psychology, Engineering Psychology, Ergonomics (Psychological Sciences).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince 1965, VNIITE, as the parent organization for design activity, has represented our country at the International Council of Design Organizations (ICSID), bearing in mind that design is one of the channels for Russia&#39;s integration into the world economy and design culture. In accordance with Order No. 1635-r of the Government of the Russian Federation of November 19, 2007 and the order of the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia, Rosnauka represented by VNIITE is charged with the work relating to the implementation of the obligations of the Russian party in the activities of ICSID.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn annual competition for the best design project among talented young people is held at VNIITE. Cooperating with the leading universities of the country and creating an intelligent database of student projects for their further implementation, the Institute contributes to the development of design and various fields of production in Russia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2014, VNIITE became part of the Moscow Technological University MIREA and was renamed into the Scientific Research Institute of Technical Aesthetics.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h1><strong>History in photos</strong></h1>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://english.mirea.ru/upload/iblock/c3d/33.jpg\"><img

There are several main reasons for it:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>● a mobile phone is often passed from hand to hand, and the owner of the phone does not always touch it with freshly washed hands;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>● the mobile phone is brought very close to the face during a conversation;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>● many owners of gadgets simply never clean them for fear of damage;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>● many people take their mobile phones with them to the toilet &ndash; the place is very &ldquo;rich&rdquo; in various pathogens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A mobile phone can play a particularly important role as a carrier of influenza pathogens, other viral respiratory infections and, in particular, the coronavirus infection COVID-19.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>How to avoid getting infected?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firstly, strictly observe hand hygiene &ndash; after visiting public places and the toilet, always wash your hands thoroughly for 20 seconds, then wipe them dry with a disposable paper towel. It is highly advisable to have antiseptic wipes or liquid products (gels, sprays, etc.) with you. This way you can always keep your hands clean, even if you can&rsquo;t wash them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSecondly, regularly apply antiseptic agents to the phone, especially where the body of the gadget is in contact with the face. If there is a cover, then it must be removed and sanitized separately (or it is better to do without it altogether).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To combat influenza and SARS viruses (and coronaviruses), it is best to use alcohol-based wipes and gels. The popular antiseptic chlorhexidine is rather intended to give protection against bacteria, but as a last resort, you can use it too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The phone should be sanitized after each visit to public places, public transport, etc. And be sure &ndash; in the evening, after the end of the working day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wearing reusable and disposable masks</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advertisements for the sale of reusable masks made of woven materials often appear in the Internet. At the same time, these masks are not a medical device and are not accompanied by instructions for use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to remember that reusable masks can only be reused after being sanitized. At home, the mask should be washed with soap or detergent, then treated with a steam generator or iron with a steam function. After processing, the mask should not remain moist, so in the end it must be ironed with a hot iron, this time without the steam function.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMedical masks are of the &quot;barrier&quot; type. The function of the mask is to trap the drops of moisture that are formed when coughing, sneezing, and in which there may be viruses &ndash; pathogens of ARVI and other respiratory diseases transmitted by airborne droplets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOTA BENE! Masks are effective only in combination with other prevention methods (avoidance of contact, frequent hand washing, disinfection of objects), and the need for their use is different for different groups of people and in different situations.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the mask should be worn by people who provide medical care and treatment to sick people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Healthy people can use the mask when visiting public places, public transport, but the effectiveness of the mask in such situations has not been proven.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOTA BENE! After two to three hours of constant use, the mask must be changed. Disposable medical masks made of nonwoven material cannot be reused or sanitized in any way. At home, a used disposable medical mask must be placed in a separate bag, hermetically sealed and only then thrown into the trash bin.</p>\r\n\r\n');

programming languages, methods and technologies, and learn to use them in practice in developing information systems (IS) with due account taken of the present-day needs for information security, reliability of operation, and immunity to external interference, including cyberattacks. That is why the IT industry of today has set forth additional requirements for software in development: in the first place, it must be safe for the entire IS infrastructure; it must be free of any potential vulnerabilities; it must interact technically correctly with its software and hardware environment (the operating system, data transmission networks, and cloud services); it must not compromise the system&rsquo;s overall security as a whole; and it must be able to detect potentially dangerous activities both outside and inside the system, whether by a human or a software tool, i.e. to possess artificial intelligence in this regard.<br />\r\nOur students master the principles of designing, building and operating IS and databases, the skills of object-oriented, network, cross-platform, automatic and multi-agent programming, plus the skills of building applied and special-purpose software and math tools. That includes programming for secure operating systems (Astra Linux, MSVS).<br />\r\nSoftware security technology is a multifaceted issue. Here is a list of some of its aspects: analysis of software security threats; formal software verification and specification methods; methods of creating algorithmically safe and effective procedures, methods and means of identifying software and verifying the integrity and authenticity of the program code; checking the executable code for the presence of program bookmarks; protection of software from unauthorized copying. In addition, present-day IT industry specialists need to know the standards and regulatory documents governing the security of software and information processed, the legal and organizational framework for the development and maintenance of IS software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alumni can be employed as</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>programmer</li>\r\n	<li>system programmer</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Program subjects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Software quality assessment</li>\r\n	<li>Foundations of information security</li>\r\n	<li>Foundations of it application and system security</li>\r\n	<li>Software system data security</li>\r\n	<li>Foundations of safe software</li>\r\n	<li>Operating system security</li>\r\n	<li>Access and data flow control models</li>\r\n	<li>Automata and formal languages theory</li>\r\n	<li>Data visualization software and mathematical tools</li>\r\n	<li>Programming language theory and translation techniques</li>\r\n	<li>Cloud technologies</li>\r\n	<li>Fundamental theory of artificial intelligence</li>\r\n	<li>Foundations of expert systems</li>\r\n	<li>Data processing and transmission techniques</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Graduating department:<br />\r\nPricing Department</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>12.03.01 Instrument making</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://english.mirea.ru/upload/resize_cache/iblock/a4f/811_500_1/12.03.01_header.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This area of instruction focuses on training highly qualified specialists who are able to design, develop, research and operate intelligent security systems, analytical instruments and systems, automation and process monitoring systems.

The first one are high-class technology experts who operate software and hardware safety tools and develop data security IT systems. Alumni occupy such positions as engineer-programmer, software developer, information systems expert, information security expert, or analyst. The other group are more associated with the humanities and deal with economic security, public order, and legal norms. Their professions are economist, auditor, accountant, tax inspector, police officer, criminal law expert, investigator, assistant judge, legal counselor, assistant counselor, or lawyer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Salaries</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The average monthly salary of an information security specialist varies within the following limits (according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://habr.com%29/\" target=\"_blank\">https://habr.com)</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- With a work record of 1 to 3 years: 40,000&ndash;70,000 rubles;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- With a work record of 3 to 6 years: 70,000&ndash;100,000 rubles;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- With a work record of 5 to 6 years: 120,000&ndash;200,000 rubles;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- With a work record of 10 years or more: 200,000 rubles and above.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Employment Prospects</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is obvious that, with the Internet developing rapidly and the danger of potential or real cyberattacks growing, the demand for information security specialists will be steadily on the rise. This is also confirmed by the fact that the government reserves large quotas of tuition-free places for students at Russian universities to be trained as such professionals at state expense. Thus, in the 2018-2019 academic year, the specialty Information Security ranked fifth in the top ten by the number of state-funded university admissions. This means that the government is in urgent need of such professionals and forms a demand for them, so our Institute&rsquo;s information security specialists will have no problems finding employment.

For that reason, without exaggeration, the students who study this technology acquire trend-setting and highly demanded professions of the future: big data analysis, predictive analytics, business process and digital device simulation, information systems design, databases and data warehouses, along with many other things. In parallel, the laboratory is used to teach programming, computer graphics, and development of virtual and augmented reality applications.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe making of a digital twin is not a simple process &mdash; it may take hours to complete. That is why the lab&rsquo;s workplaces are very comfortable. The computer chairs are adjustable to the researcher&rsquo;s anthropometric characteristics: you can change the position of your body, place your arms and hands conveniently on the armrests, and adjust the footrest. Three monitors allow you to work with multiple information streams or sources simultaneously. As an example, one screen can serve as a work area, the second may be used to visualize a model, schematic drawing or work task, and the third screen to display reference materials.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe laboratory is used for the training of groups pursuing master&rsquo;s and bachelor&rsquo;s programs (starting from the second year of studies) in all areas of the IT Institute&rsquo;s education, regardless of the students&rsquo; specific major.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mirea.ru/upload/medialibrary/93f/DSC00658.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.mirea.ru/upload/medialibrary/93f/DSC00658.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mirea.ru/upload/medialibrary/6c8/DSC00663.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.mirea.ru/upload/medialibrary/6c8/DSC00663.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mirea.ru/upload/medialibrary/864/DSC00665.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.mirea.ru/upload/medialibrary/864/DSC00665.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mirea.ru/upload/medialibrary/0e9/DSC00670.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.mirea.ru/upload/medialibrary/0e9/DSC00670.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mirea.ru/upload/medialibrary/fce/DSC00674.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.mirea.ru/upload/medialibrary/fce/DSC00674.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mirea.ru/upload/medialibrary/358/DSC00677.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.mirea.ru/upload/medialibrary/358/DSC00677.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mirea.ru/upload/medialibrary/63b/DSC00678.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.mirea.ru/upload/medialibrary/63b/DSC00678.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mirea.ru/upload/medialibrary/394/DSC00680.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.mirea.ru/upload/medialibrary/394/DSC00680.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n', '4.jpg', '4'),

Our colleagues also have amazing breakthrough works in various fields of research: applied mathematics, physics, and materials science.<br />\n⠀<br />\nOne of the main tasks of the Year of Science is to raise the prestige of science in the eyes of young people.
